# 100 days of algorithms in core Java

This repository contains notebooks with live code to accompany 100 days of algorithms challenge.

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches 100.

The challenge was quite fun and rough, as well. Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free. Do expect to see code written in haste. A code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

Feel free to (re)use my code in any way you wish, but bare in mind that the source code is provided "as-is". It is on your own risk and you are solely responsible for whatever happens then.

This repository gets ideas from: https://github.com/coells/100days (100 days of algorithms in Python of coells)
